# Asteroid Trajectory Analysis 🚀

Asteroid Trajectory Analysis is a data engineering project that ingests, processes, and analyzes asteroid trajectory data using NASA's NEO API. The project supports batch and real-time data pipelines, enabling comprehensive insights into asteroid movements, historical trajectories, and potential risks.

---

## 🌟 **Features**
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Uses Apache Airflow to fetch daily asteroid trajectory data.
- **Batch Data Processing**: Processes 10 years of historical asteroid data.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleanses and aggregates data using PySpark.
- **Data Storage**: Stores both raw and processed data in AWS S3.
- **Querying**: Uses AWS Athena to generate actionable insights.
- **Lambda Automation**: AWS Lambda checks for new files in S3 and updates the Athena table automatically with the latest records.
- **Visualization**: Power BI dashboard visualizes key metrics like trajectory paths and hazardous asteroids.
- **Future Scope**: Incorporates predictive analytics using machine learning.

## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**

Here’s how the system is designed:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Historical data is fetched from APIs and loaded into AWS S3.
   - Real-time data ingestion is managed using Apache Kafka and Airflow.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - PySpark scripts process, clean, and aggregate data.
   - Aggregated data is stored in S3 for querying.

3. **Automated Table Updates**:
   - AWS Lambda is triggered when a new file is uploaded to S3.
   - Lambda runs an AWS Glue crawler or directly updates the Athena table with the new schema or data.

4. **Data Analytics**:
   - AWS Athena queries aggregated data stored in S3.
   - Power BI connects to Athena for visualization.

5. **Pipeline Automation**:
   - Airflow DAGs schedule and monitor all ETL tasks.
